               <Description>This class of functions is for practitioners working with                        species occurrence data and taxonomic profiles. It helps them to                        generate new knowledge from this data (e.g. modeling and analyzing                        distribution data, comparing checklists, and producing maps).                </Description>

                     <Description>This function provides the Virtual Research Environment                                        with services for discovering and accessing species occurrence and                                        taxonomic data from major repositories and information systems. The                                        discovery mechanism is simple (based on species common names or                                        scientific names) yet powerful since it supports query expansion                                        and additional filters. The identified datasets are enriched with                                        links to other species, can be displayed on a map as well as saved                                        in standard formats (e.g. DarwinCore, DarwinCore-Archive, CSV) for                                        future uses.</Description>
