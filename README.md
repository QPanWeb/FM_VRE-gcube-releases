gCube is an open-source software toolkit used for building and operating Hybrid Data Infrastructures enabling the dynamic deployment of Virtual Research Environments by favouring the realisation of reuse oriented policies.

gCube offers components supporting typical data management workflows including data access, curation, processing, and visualisation on a large set of data typologies ranging from primary biodiversity data to geospatial and tabular data.

gCube has been used to successfully build and operate infrastructures and virtual research environments for application domains ranging from biodiversity to environmental data management and cultural heritage.
