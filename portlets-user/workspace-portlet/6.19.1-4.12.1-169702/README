The gCube System - gCube Workspace Portlet
--------------------------------------------------
 
gCube Workspace Portlet is a web-gui to manage the gCube workspace a collaborative area where users can exchange and organize information objects (workspace items) according to their specific needs. 
		Every user of any Virtual Research Environment is provided with this area for the exchange of workspace objects (share) with other users. 
		Such an area is further organized in workspaces as to resemble a classic folder-based file system.
 
 
This software is part of the gCube Framework (https://www.gcube-system.org/): an
open-source software toolkit used for building and operating Hybrid Data
Infrastructures enabling the dynamic deployment of Virtual Research Environments
by favouring the realisation of reuse oriented policies.
