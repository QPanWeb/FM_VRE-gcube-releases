	<p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Split Operation:</p>
	<p>The operation divides the values of a target column into two
		values compiling two separate columns.</p>
	<p>The split can be performed:</p>


	<dl>
		<dt>
			<a name="schrs">* by Char Sequence:</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			i.e. the target value is divided by the first occurrence of a
			specific character or sequence of characters
			<p>for instance, if the target value is "Fis-12345” and the split
				string is “-“ then the operation produces “Fis” and "-12345”</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<a name="sind">* by Index</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			i.e. the target value is divided by the n-th character
			<p>for instance, if the target value is "Fis-12345” and the index
				string is “2“ then the operation produces “F” and “is-12345”;</p>

		</dd>
		<dt>
			<a name="sreg">* by Regex</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			i.e. the target value is divided by the first occurrence of the given
			Regex
			<!-- 			<p>for instance, </p> -->
		</dd>
	</dl>

<div>
	<p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Merge Operation:</p>
	<p>The operation combines the values of two target columns into a
		single value compiling a new column. The values are managed as strings
		and the new value is produce by appending the second value to the
		first. It is possible to specify a separator string.</p>
	<p>For instance, if the values to be merged are “Fis” and “12345”
		and the separator is “-“, then the operation produces "Fis-12345”</p>
