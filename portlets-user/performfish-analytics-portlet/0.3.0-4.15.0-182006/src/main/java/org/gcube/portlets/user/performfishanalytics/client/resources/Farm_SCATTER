The scatter plot is a two-dimensional chart displaying farm data for two KPIs. User’s data is displayed as point, each having the value of one KPI determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other KPI determining the position on the vertical axis. The position of the user’s farm is displayed with respect to other farms in the VRE (anonymous). Colour coded summary statistics (i.e. median and quartiles) are reported for each axis.
