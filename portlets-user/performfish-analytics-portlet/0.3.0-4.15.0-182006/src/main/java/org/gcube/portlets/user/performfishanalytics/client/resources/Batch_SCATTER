The scatter plot is a two-dimensional chart displaying batch data for two KPIs. User’s data is displayed as point, each having the value of one KPI determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other KPI determining the position on the vertical axis. The position of the user’s batches is displayed with respect to farms’ batches in the VRE (anonymous). When the analysis is carried out on a single batch, an arrowhead indicates the selected batch data. Colour coded summary statistics (i.e. median and quartiles) are reported for each axis.
