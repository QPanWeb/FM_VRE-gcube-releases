The correlation matrix is a table displaying the correlation between pairs of KPIs. Correlation coefficients are calculated using the Person parametric correlation test and coloured according to the value in red (significant positive correlation), yellow (significant negative correlation), and in light blue (non-significant correlation). The Student t-test is used to determine the ranges of correlation for Pearson coefficients.
