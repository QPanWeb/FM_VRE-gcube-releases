The performeter is a chart displaying the quantity and quality of KPI batch value over a radial scale. It shows the range (i.e. minimum, maximum) and the KPI value of batch data analysed in the VRE in a coloured range. Five colours categories are assigned to indicate different performances in the KPI (i.e. very good, good, normal, bad, and very bad). The pointer indicates the absolute value of the KPI and its position in the range. When the analysis is carried out on a single batch, the KPI value will refer to the batch value, while on all batches, the KPI value is calculated on all userâ€™s batches.
For KPIs having percentage as unit of measure, the range and the KPI value are normalised (scaled) between 0 and 100, where 0 indicates the minimum KPI value in the VRE and 100 the maximum.
For KPIs having number as unit of measure, the range and the KPI value are reported between the minimum and maximum KPI value in the VRE.
