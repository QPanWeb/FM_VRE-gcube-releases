Dear {{GATEWAY_NAME}} user,

we want to make you aware that this Monday, November 19th at 1:00pm CET, there will be scheduled down time for approximately 3 hours. 

During this maintenance window, the Gateway may be inaccessible. 
Operations will resume after the maintenance window, however we cannot guarantee the complete functioning of all services until 6:00pm CET.

We appreciate your patience and understanding and will make every effort to minimize this maintenance window.
