Dear {{GATEWAY_NAME}} user,

Tomorrow, December 19th from 2:00pm to 6:00pm CET some services including Workspace and Social and Data Miner applications may be temporarily unavailable for a short time.
We appreciate your patience and understanding. 

Motivation: D4Science infrastructure upgrade to gCube 4.9.0

We will make every effort to minimize any downtime associated with this maintenance.
