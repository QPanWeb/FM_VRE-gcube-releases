ISCache is a small utility mainly for getting endpoint references of gCube services/resources.

File ISCache.doc describes very thoroughly the usage, architecture and internals of ISCache.

In order to test ISCache capabilities, please run the script file runTest.sh

This file starts an ISCache deamon and JConsole. ISCache is fully JMX-enabled and thus it can be extensively tested using JConsole as its client.

Once JConsole starts, go to org.gcube subtree at the left side of the MBeans tab. There you can find all the available operations. 

In order to validate their output, compare it with ISMonitoring results.
